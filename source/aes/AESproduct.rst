AES for Business: Product Description
=====================================

With AES for Business, your company domain (e.g. yourcompany.com)
enables signing at the AES standard. Anyone who registers with Skribble using an e-mail address from your organisation (e.g. jsmith@yourcompany.com) and is a member of your Business account can sign with AES without any further action.

This provides several benefits:
  - When your employees create a Skribble account, they will automatically be signing at the AES level without having to add their personal phone number as identification.
  - Users personal phone number will not be shown in the certificate since their company email provides their identification.
  - Users can sign at the AES level without having a Swiss phone number.

A guide for setting up AES for Business can be found :ref:`here <aes-setup>`.
