Signing documents from Google Drive
===================================

.. NOTE::
  This is a beta feature available to a limited group of Skribble Business customers.
  
Once your Google Drive admin connects your company's Skribble Business with Google Drive, you'll be able to sign with Skribble directly from your Google Drive Web App (not the local version on your computer).

To sign a document from Google Drive (video tutorial available `here`_):

.. _here: https://youtu.be/zKqAU9ke46I

- Go to Google Drive Web App at `drive.google.com/drive`_

.. _drive.google.com/drive: https://drive.google.com/drive

If you're not logged in yet, please make sure to log in with the same e-mail address you use to log in to your Skribble account.

- **Right-click** on the document you want to sign
