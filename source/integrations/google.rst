Setting up signing with Skribble from Google Drive
==================================================

.. NOTE::
 This is a beta feature available to a limited group of Skribble Business customers.

Skribble integrates easily with Google Drive and enables companies, departments, and teams to sign and get documents signed electronically directly from their favourite tools.

If you use Google Drive and Skribble Business, you can connect them in just a few easy steps. To do so, you’ll need:

•	**Admin access to your company’s Google Drive**
•	**Skribble API credentials**
•	**Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in**

We recommend that the Google Drive admin does the setup of the Skribble Electronic Signature plug-in. Skribble Business admins might not have all the necessary rights to finish the setup on Google Drive.
